 The ERC1155D contract is a gas efficient NFT contract. An alternative to ERC721. It is intended to only be used for 1/1 NFT's (supply of 1) and does not support tokens with supply greater than 1.


## Features

- Users can mint 1/1 nft's(supply of 1) and does not support tokens with supply greater than 1.
- ERC1155D does not maintain tokenID enumeration.


## Use case

To use the ERC1155D contract in your project, copy contracts/ERC1155D.sol to your project. Then, you can import it, and write an implementation that extends the contract as is ERC1155
